# How to Use Notion as a CMS

Notion is a powerful online database tool with nearly infinite flexibility. For this reason, it’s attracted dedicated users since it was first launch. In 2021, it published a public Notion API in beta, making it yet more accessible and customizable! In this video series, I'll show you how to use Notion as a light-weight CMS. While not ideal for scaffolding out an entire site, it can act as a very capable CMS for users with mostly static content. For the one or two sections on your site that need regular updating, why not use something like Notion? 

I'll show you how to: 
1. Create the basic site with ViteJS and Open Props using HTML and CSS
2. Set up Notion and create and add an API Integration
3. Publish your site to Netlify for free
4. Create a Netlify serverless function with the Notion SDK for JavaScript and the Netlify CLI (including environmental variables)
5. How to fetch the live Notion data from your Netlify serverless function
6. Write a skeleton loading animation to improve the site UX
